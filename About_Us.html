		<p id="intro-paragraph">The Vintage Rally Club of South East Asia (VRCSA) is about vintage automobiles and the pleasure of the sport. Since its beginning in 1952, the Members of the VRCSA have been dedicated to the collection, preservation and enjoyment of the finest cars in South East Asia. Automobiles manufactured from 1915 to 1980 remain the primary focus of the club today. VRCSA members have held Grand ClassicÂ® car shows, enjoyed CARavans and published The Classic Car magazine plus other materials every year since the Club's founding.

				<span class="info-text" id="text2"><span class="aboutimage"><img src="Images/antiquecar.jpg" class="about-image" alt="Old Car Picture"></span><span class="para">The year was 1951. Owners of Packards and the like - vintage late 1920's to early 1930's - found to their chagrin, upon arriving at old car meets, that they were ineligible to participate as their vehicles were termed "modern". Vintage Club of South East Asia, the nation's oldest organization, had relegated the enthusiasts' chosen wheels to Class 19, designated "Tow Cars." Since these vehicles were, to their minds more properly defined by the term "Classic", a new organization seemed called for. The VRCSA was born later that year, In March of 1952, entertainer Herb Shriner invited the fledgling club to exhibit at the Local Motor Sport Show held at the Karaweik Park. Before the show, VRCSA membership stood at twenty. By the end of the show, seventy five more enthusiasts had been signed up.</span>
